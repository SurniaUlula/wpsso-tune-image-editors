**WPSSO Core add-on to provide tuning options for the WordPress and PHP image extensions.**

WPSSO Tune Image Editors is *incredibly fast* and coded for performance &mdash; WPSSO Core and its add-ons make full use of all available caching techniques (persistent / non-persistent object and disk caching), and load only the PHP library files and object classes they need, keeping their code small, fast, and light. WPSSO Core and its add-ons are also fully tested and compatible with PHP v7.x (PHP v5.4 or better required).
